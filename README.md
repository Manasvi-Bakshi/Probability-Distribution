# Applied Statistical Methods 

## Introduction
This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of **lab assignments** completed during the Applied Statistical Methods course. The experiments were designed to enhance my understanding of statistical concepts and their practical applications using various statistical tools and programming languages.

## Topics Covered
The assignments cover the following topics:

1. **Probability Basics**: Fundamental principles of probability, including conditional probability, Bayes' theorem, and probability rules.
2. **Statistical Basics**: Descriptive statistics, measures of central tendency, and variability.
3. **Advanced Statistical Hypothesis Testing**:
   - **Z-test**: For comparing sample and population means.
   - **T-test**: For comparing means of two samples (independent and paired).
4. **Probability Distributions**:
   - Discrete distributions (e.g., Binomial, Poisson)
   - Continuous distributions (e.g., Normal, Exponential)
5. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimensionality reduction techniques to analyze large datasets.
6. **Regression Models**:
   - **Univariate Regression**: Simple linear regression.
   - **Multivariate Regression**: Multiple predictors to estimate the response variable.
7. **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)**: Techniques for comparing means across multiple groups.
8. **Time Series Analysis**:
   - **Moving Average (MA)**: Smoothing techniques to identify trends.
   - **Autoregressive (AR)**: Using past values for prediction.
   - **Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA)**: Combination of AR and MA for modeling time series data.
9. **Markov Chains**: Stochastic processes for predicting sequence states based on current state probabilities.
